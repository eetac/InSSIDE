# GoData extension offering DRM service

_Anonymization of GoData cases which helps provide the anonymization of patiens without loosing the ability of GoData contact tracing. Thus providing privacy and security for patient sensitive data while keeping unsensitive information available for the hospitals and epidemiologist_

## Taking off 🚀

_These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes._

Go to **Deployment** to deploy the project.


### Pre-requisites 📋

1. Running GoData Server with registered User is required
2. Mongodb BDD is required

### Installation 🔧

_First install the DRM Server packages,_
```
cd Go.Data_Enc_Serv\
npm install
```
_Next install packages for chrome anonymization extension_
```
cd Go.Data_Enc_Serv\
npm install
```
_Also need to configure the GoData URL which lets know the DRM server where the GoData server is located, which could be a real location, or can be the locally hosted GoData._

```
Make a copy of the file Go.Data_Enc_Serv\src\lib\config_example.ts and rename it to config.ts 
```
_Once we have a config.ts file, we need to fill the empty values_
```
    URL             :   "http://localhost:3000/api", //Go Data URI
    IV_LENGTH       :   16, // Minimum Length 16 IV
    saltRounds      :   10, // Hash Function Rounds, recommended for security at least 10
    EMAIL           :   "encryption@local.com", //Email used to enter godata server for admin
    HOSPITAL        :   "admin", // Hospital Name, in our case it is the administrator name for DRM server
    USER_GODATA_ID  :   "9fd48f7a-58c9-44de-836b-5743c9845b3b",
    PASSWORD        :   "NobodyShallPass", //Password in clear, used to access GoData
    DOCUMENT_HASH   :   "LNG_REFERENCE_DATA_CATEGORY_DOCUMENT_TYPE_HASHID",
    USER_AGENT      :   "GoData LocalHost Connector 2.5.6",
    OUTBREAK_ID     :   "33227825-a497-46ae-a8b9-8ee30921db3e", //Outbreak Id in GoData
    SENSITIVE_DATA   :   ["firstName","middleName","lastName","documents,number","addresses,phoneNumber"],
    // MongoDB Uri for DRM server, different from GoData/can be the same too!
    DB              :   {
        URI     : process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/DRM',
        USER    : process.env.MONGODB_USER,
        PASSWORD: process.env.MONGODB_PASSWORD
    },
    AUTO_ENCRYPTION_TIMER: 0 // If the time is too short it will only auto encrypt when the previous is complete!
```
